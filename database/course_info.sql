(1, 'Adobe Photoshop', 122.3, 'c1.JFIF', 'Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software\'s name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb although Adobe discourages such use.[5] Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.\r\nPhotoshop\'s naming scheme was initially based on version numbers. However, in October 2002 (following the introduction of Creative Suite branding), each new version of Photoshop was designated with  plus a number; e.g., the eighth major version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS and the ninth was Photoshop CS2. Photoshop CS3 through CS6 were also distributed in two different editions: Standard and Extended. With the introduction of the Creative Cloud branding in June 2013 (and in turn, the change of the ), Photoshop\'s licensing scheme was changed to that of software as a service subscription model. Historically, Photoshop was bundled with additional software such as Adobe ImageReady, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Device Central and Adobe Camera RAW.\r\nAlongside Photoshop, Adobe also develops and publishes Photoshop Elements, Photoshop Lightroom, Photoshop Express, Photoshop Fix, Photoshop Sketch and Photoshop Mix. As of November 2019, Adobe has also released a full version of Photoshop for the iPad, and while initially limited, Adobe plans to bring more features to Photoshop for iPad. Collectively.', 1),

In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.\r\n\r\nHTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.\r\n\r\nThe code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.\r\n\r\nThe History of HTML\r\nHTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.\r\n\r\nHypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.\r\n\r\nA Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.\r\n\r\nWhat are Tags and Attributes?\r\nTags and attributes are the basis of HTML.\r\n\r\nThey work together but perform different functions – it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.\r\n\r\nWhat Are HTML Tags?\r\nTags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: <h1>.\r\n\r\nMost tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> in order to function.\r\n\r\nWhat are HTML Attributes?\r\nAttributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.\r\n\r\nAn example of an attribute is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.\r\n\r\nGolden Rules To Remember\r\nThe vast majority of tags must be opened (<tag>) and closed (</tag>) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.\r\nWhen using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. For example:\r\n\r\n<strong><em>This is really important!</em></strong>\r\nHTML Editors\r\nNow that we’ve gotten the basic theory out of the way. It’s time to learn how to build our first website.\r\n\r\nFirst off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important, we need an HTML editor.\r\n\r\nThere are many choices on the market. Here are a handful of the most popular:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead more: https://html.com/#ixzz785Kv4B4g', 5),
(3, 'Digital Marketing', 100, 'c6.JFIF', 'What is digital marketing?\r\nAt a high level, digital marketing refers to advertising delivered through digital channels such as search engines, websites, social media, email, and mobile apps. Using these online media channels, digital marketing is the method by which companies endorse goods, services, and brands. Consumers heavily rely on digital means to research products. For example, Think with Google marketing insights found that 48% of consumers start their inquiries on search engines, while 33% look to brand websites and 26% search within mobile applications.\r\n\r\nWhile modern day digital marketing is an enormous system of channels to which marketers simply must onboard their brands, advertising online is much more complex than the channels alone. In order to achieve the true potential of digital marketing, marketers have to dig deep into today’s vast and intricate cross-channel world to discover strategies that make an impact through engagement marketing. Engagement marketing is the method of forming meaningful interactions with potential and returning customers based on the data you collect over time. By engaging customers in a digital landscape, you build brand awareness, set yourself as an industry thought leader, and place your business at the forefront when the customer is ready to buy.\r\n\r\nBy implementing an omnichannel digital marketing strategy, marketers can collect valuable insights into target audience behaviors while opening the door to new methods of customer engagement. Additionally, companies can expect to see an increase in retention. According to a report by Invesp, companies with strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies retain an average of 89% of their customers compared to companies with weak omnichannel programs that have a retention rate of just 33%. \r\n\r\nAs for the future of digital marketing, we can expect to see a continued increase in the variety of wearable devices available to consumers. Forbes also forecasts that social media will become increasingly conversational in the B2B space, video content will be refined for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes, and email marketing will become even more personalized.\r\n\r\n“Digital is at the core of everything in marketing today—it has gone from ‘one of the things marketing does’ to ‘THE thing that marketing does.’”\r\n\r\n – Sanjay Dholakia, Former Chief Marketing Officer, Marketo\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCommon problems that digital marketing can solve\r\nTo optimize your marketing strategies, digital is mandatory. Digital marketing can help you to get to know your audience, learn important data about them, and provide metrics that will give your marketing team credibility.\r\n\r\nProblem: I don’t know my audience well enough to get started. Getting to know your audience takes time, and while your marketing team may have developed audience personas that can be of use, consumers actively spending time online may not behave in the way you’d expect. You’ll need to test different language with different targets, keeping in mind that certain descriptors will appeal to different people and their place in the buying cycle. Attune yourself to your audience and you’ll build credibility that will set you apart from the competition. \r\n\r\nProblem: I haven’t optimized my channels for SEO. Regardless of your position in the marketing process, it’s important to have an understanding of SEO best practices. In addition to improving search engine ranking, SEO can reinforce and support your campaign testing and optimization to ensure you’re delivering high quality, valuable content that your potential customers want. \r\n\r\nProblem: I don’t have a social media strategy. Regardless of whether you want to develop an organic social media strategy, a paid social media strategy, or a blend of the two, it’s important to have some form of social marketing in place. While social media is excellent for branding and engagement, it can also be a useful channel for digital marketing advertisement. Find a niche and a consistent voice, be patient, and as your following increases, the impact of your ads will increase as well.\r\n\r\nProblem: My marketing teams are siloed. It’s important to break out of silos to create nimble, fluid structures. Your customers aren’t sequestered in one channel waiting for ads, so your marketing efforts must deploy cross-channel functionality with teams that bring multiple skill sets to the table to engage customers where they are. Each social network and channel includes different audiences and expectations, so marketing efforts may look completely different for each. This includes tone, imagery, offers, and even the time of day you post.\r\n\r\nProblem: I’m under pressure from my CMO to report on metrics that support the bottom line. Digital marketing supports a vast universe of metrics that can be utilized to determine the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, but these metrics should be chosen with care. Each case will depend upon your audience makeup and focus on each channel. Keeping this in mind, start by determining your goals for each channel and set metrics your CMO will want to see the most.', 4),
(5, 'JavaScript (JS)', 400, 'c4.png', 'JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.\r\nThis section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.\r\nThe standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features.\r\n\r\nDo not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.\r\n\r\nLooking to become a front-end web developer?\r\n\r\nWe have put together a course that includes all the essential information you need to work towards your goal.\r\n\r\nGet started\r\n\r\nTutorials\r\nLearn how to program in JavaScript with guides and tutorials.\r\n\r\nFor complete beginners\r\nHead over to our Learning Area JavaScript topic if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous experience with JavaScript or programming.
